			<p>
				To be honest, the main idea behind this little project was to practice
				with CSS. To be more precise, to practice responsive and adaptive design
				without using third-party frameworks. After that, the idea came that
				this could serve as my modest business card. Why not? I know there are
				places that could be done better. Over time, I will definitely improve
				them. If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to contact me via
				the contact form.
